Weekly Progress Report: DhanMatrixCapital Engineering
Date: January 13, 2026
Period: Jan 6, 2026 – Jan 13, 2026

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
This week focused on a major aesthetic transformation, mobile ergonomics, and platform stability. We successfully executed a comprehensive rebranding to "DhanMatrixCapital," transitioned the design system to a premium light theme, and conducted a rigorous "de-zooming" audit to ensure a native-app-like experience on mobile. On the engineering side, we hardened the infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines, resolved critical React rendering issues, and optimized performance.


UI/UX & DESIGN SYSTEMS
======================

1. Mobile Experience ("De-Zooming" Audit)
   - Typography Scale: Implemented a stricter mobile type scale (reducing base sizes from 18px to 14/16px) to increase information density.
   - Layout Ergonomics: Tightened padding and margins across the Homepage, Plans, Dashboard, Login, and Register pages to eliminate the "zoomed-in" feeling.
   - Touch Targets: Optimized buttons and interactive elements for better thumb reachability without looking "chunky."
   - Visual Hierarchy: Refined the visual weight of secondary text.

2. Major Re-Design & Rebranding
   - Brand Identity: Standardized the brand name to "DhanMatrixCapital" across the entire codebase.
   - Theme Update: Transitioned the default theme to Light Mode for a cleaner, institutional-grade financial look.

   - GitHub Actions: Implemented a robust CI pipeline to automatically run build and lint checks on every push/PR.
   - Build Repairs: Fixed various build failures in dashboard and profile pages.
